    <strong>proXXy</strong> is a powerful tool designed for acquiring and managing a vast quantity of proxies. It is used to gather, organize, and procure HTTP/S, SOCKS4, and SOCKS5 proxies. They can be used for web scraping, penetration testing, bypassing censorship, and many other tasks!
  </p>
  
  <p align="center">
    The software is currently capable of retrieving over 500,000 proxies from many different sources.

## Installation

- Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Atropa-Solanaceae/proXXy.git
```

- Navigate to project directory:

```bash
cd proXXy
```

- Install dependencies with `poetry`:

```bash
poetry install
```

If you don't have `poetry` installed, install it [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

## Usage

- Activate the poetry shell:

```bash
poetry shell
```

- Running the program without flags results in only scraping, as checking is disabled by default:

```bash
python3 proXXy.py
```

The program will modify four files in the `output/` directory with your proxies:

- `HTTP.txt`
- `HTTPS.txt`
- `SOCKS4.txt`
- `SOCKS5.txt`

 with a logfile (`error.log`) with warnings/errors.

## Flags

Syntax for running proXXy is as follows:

```bash
usage: proXXy.py [-h] [--validate] [--update] [--version] [--src_check]
```

1. `-V, --validate`: This flag enables proxy validation. The scraper will look to validate the scraped proxies by checking their accessibility.

2. `-u, --update`: This flag updates the project. Cannot be used in conjunction with any other flag.

3. `-h, --help`: Use this flag to spit out a help menu.

4. `-v, --version`: Use this flag to spit out `proXXy.py`'s version.

5. `-s, --src_check`: Use this flag to categorize the sources according to how many proxies they provide.

```bash
usage: proXXy.py [-h] [--validate] [--update] [--version] [--src_check]

A super simple asynchronous multithreaded proxy scraper;
scraping & checking ~500k HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS4, & SOCKS5 proxies.

options:
  -h, --help      show this help message and exit
  --validate, -v  Flag to validate proxies after scraping (default: False)
  --update, -u    Flag to run the update script and then exit
  --version, -V   Print the version of the script and exit
  --src_check, -s Flag to verify sources
```

## Planned Features

- Add URL rotation
- Fix Unix-like compatibility errors. `proXXy` currently does not support unix-like verification.
- Allow the user to choose the number of threads they'd like to use with flags, & provide the user recommended values based on their hardware.
- Implement SOCKS4 & SOCKS5 testing.
- Proxy sorting instead of hardcoding.
- Discerning between Elite, Anonymous, and Transparent anonymity classes of proxies.
